  <br></br>
  &emsp;Often, people have misunderstandings when <em>communicating</em> with one another. This happens due to the different environments, social-economic upbringings, education and many other uncontrollable factors. By <b>arming</b> oneself with knowledge, one is able to educate and themself, and others to facilitate and have more amicable discourse between eachother.

            ">&emsp;My name is Jonathan. Im a firm believer in understanding one another through knowledge and education. By putting yourself in another person's shoes, you can better understand their view point and foster a better relationship. If everyone is able to have positive interactions and communicater with eachother, it will lead to a better world overall. This opens an avenue for improving the lives of those around your and by extension yourself.
