      Hello, this is my first html page assignment for the micro-credential boot camp. My name is Jonathan and I am a senior at Lehman college. Spring 2022 will be my first and final semester on campus. I love all sorts of things, but learning is probably my favorite thing to do. Currently I work odd jobs and help my girlfriend with her online business while attending school full-time.
