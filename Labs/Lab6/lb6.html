    <h5>Lab# 6</h5>
    <p> In this lab we went to code.org and watched some videos on how pixels are used with binary bits to create the images we see on screen. We played around with their "pixelator" tool and changed both binary and hexadecimal values in order to change what color a pixel displayed. By changing the first 16 bits, we changed the size of the canvas. The other subsequent pixels were turned defined to have a certain amount of bits, in sets of three, one set of bits for red, one fore blue, and one for green. In the favicon we used a 32 by 32 pixel grid, represented by the binary number 0010 0000 0010 0000 and number of bits per pixel represented by: 0001 1000. Since we had 5 minutes to create an icon, I used random hexadecimals for the pixel values, ranging from 0-F. Each color was represented by 2 hexadecimal characters.
    <br></br>
  The flavicon we created was then linked using the link tag with a rel of icon. It is displayed at the top to the left of the title in the tab. The image has been blown up below for your viewing pleasure.
